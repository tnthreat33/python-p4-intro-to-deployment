# Intro to Deployment

## Learning Goals

- Understand what "deploying" means.
- Understand the responsibilities of a web server.
- Evaluate platforms for deploying Flask applications..

***

## Key Vocab

- **Deployment**: the processes that make an application available for its
  intended use. For web applications, this means moving the application to a
  platform that supports requests from the internet.
- **Developer Operations (DevOps)**: the practices and tools that improve a
  team's ability to develop and deploy applications quickly.
- **PostgreSQL**: an open-source relational database system that provides more
  SQL functionality than SQLite. Unlike SQLite, its data is stored on a server
  rather than in files.
- **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**: a development and deployment platform that
  exists on a wide range of servers with different functionality. PaaS solutions
  reduce maintenance time for a software development team, but can increase
  cost. Some PaaS solutions, such as Render, provide free tiers for small
  applications.

## Introduction

So far during this phase, we've been working on developing applications and
running them locally on our own computers. If we want other folks to be able to
interact with our applications, that means we need to deploy them to another
computer that's configured to allow requests over the internet, from anywhere in
the world!

This process essentially involves:

- taking our application's code...
- uploading it to a server that's configured to run our code and allow HTTP
  requests...
- and running our code on that server.

As a web developer, it's essential to familiarize yourself with the deployment
process for a few reasons:

- It's increasingly expected that developers participate in the deployment
  process. While many companies employ specialized DevOps (Developer Operations)
  engineers, it is not uncommon for engineers on other teams to have a hand in
  deploying and troubleshooting issues in production.
- Deploying your site early in the development process can be helpful for
  catching bugs that you may not encounter running your code locally,
  particularly when it comes to project dependencies and working with
  third-party services.
- Understanding how your app will perform in different environments (development
  and production) can help you optimize your code's performance.

In this lesson, we'll explore the deploying process and identify the things a
web server needs in order to host a Flask application.

## Defining a Web Server

All web servers share the same common goal: they must be able to handle HTTP
requests, and send back a response. The simplest kind of websites are known as
[**static** websites][static web page], which typically means sites that store
all their content in pre-built HTML, JavaScript and CSS files that are saved to
the file system and sent back when a client makes a request for that specific file:

[static web page]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page

Static websites are still quite common on the web; but there's also a large portion
of the web that is [**dynamic**][dynamic web page]. With dynamic pages, the content
returned from an HTTP request isn't derived from just an HTML file, but instead is
processed by some code running on the server before it's sent back to the client.
All Flask applications are **dynamic**, since every request needs to be processed
by Flask in order to determine the correct response.

Since hosting a server for dynamic websites is a bit more complicated, let's
discuss some things a dynamic server needs in order to do its job.

## Application Environment

One big consideration for developing any application is: what _environments_
does the application need to run in?

Broadly speaking, application environments are split into three categories:

- **Development**: When you're working on your application locally, running the
  code on your personal computer, it's running in the **development**
  environment. In a development environment, you should be able to easily use
  debugging tools (like `ipdb`), and code analysis tools (like ESLint, which
  warns you when you're using React incorrectly). You should be able to quickly
  see the result of adding new code and how that affects your application.
- **Testing**: When your test runner (like pytest or Jest) is running, it runs in
  a **testing** environment. In this environment, your code should run as
  quickly as possible so that you can get rapid feedback on your application by
  running your test suite. It should also be as close as possible to your
  production environment (though this comes with tradeoffs related to how
  quickly your tests can run).
- **Production**: When your application is deployed to a server, it will be
  running in a **production** environment. Some features you have available in
  the development environment, like debugging tools and hot-reloading when code
  changes, aren't available in this environment. Instead, the focuses of a
  production environment are to run your application quickly; be resilient to
  errors (and to keep a log of what goes wrong); to handle lots of traffic; and
  generally to make your application as great as it can be for your users.

> Other environments you may use when building an application are a QA (quality
> assurance, for manual testing of features) environment and a staging
> environment (a preview of the production environment, usually used as the last
> stage before deploying a new feature). These are standard for larger teams.

Take a moment to think about all the things that are required to run a Flask
application in your local development environment. When you're working on a lab,
what setup is needed so that you can type `python app.py` in the terminal, and
view your website in the browser?

For starters, there's your _environment setup_: you could be running on OSX, or
WSL, or Linux; you'll need to have a recent version of Python installed; you'll
need Git for version control; and a few other system dependencies.

There are also all of your _application dependencies_: the code specific to
your Flask app that needs to run. That includes the Flask library itself as well
as all the other libraries in your Pipfile.

You'll also need some kind of _database_ to persist all your data. It's helpful
to think of the database in isolation from the rest of your application, as a
kind of resource that's available to your Flask app; ideally, even if your Flask
app goes down for some reason, your database shouldn't go down with it!

> A note on databases: for the labs in this phase, we've been using SQLite as a
> lightweight database. It's great for quick development, but it doesn't scale
> well to larger applications. We'll be using PostgreSQL for our database moving
> forward. More on that later!

Since all of these elements are required in order to run our application,
whatever system we choose to deploy our code on will need to be able to handle a
similar environment setup. Let's explore some options.

***

## Deploying Options

When it comes to deciding which platform to use to host our deployed
applications, there are a number of options, each of which comes with some
tradeoffs. For Flask in particular, a few popular choices are:

- [Heroku][heroku]
- [Amazon Web Services (AWS)][aws]
- [Digital Ocean][digital ocean]
- [Render][render]

[heroku]: https://www.heroku.com/about
[aws]: https://aws.amazon.com/
[digital ocean]: https://www.digitalocean.com/
[render]: https://render.com/

One thing these services all have in common: they all have the ability to easily
configure an environment to run our Flask applications in. These services own
the hardware (the physical servers and networking infrastructure) that your code
will run on, but they also have configurable [**containers**][containers] with
resources dedicated to run your code.

[containers]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS-level_virtualization

These containers are what makes it possible to quickly and easily set up a new
production environment that has all the functionality needed to run your site:

- **OS**: Typically Linux. Applications like Flask work well across platforms,
  so even if you're using a different OS in development, deploying to a server
  that runs Linux works just fine!
- **Python**: You should use the exact same version of Python in development and
  in production. Since new Python versions have new features, as well as fixing
  security issues in older versions, it's critical to use the same version in
  both environments.
- **NodeJS**: It's important to use the same NodeJS version in both environments
  for the same reasons listed for Python.
- **Database**: While it's possible to use different databases in a development
  and production environment, it's generally not a good idea to do so: there are
  some differences in how (for example) SQLite and PostgreSQL interpret
  different SQL commands and what features are available in both, so it's
  considered a best practice to use the same database in development and in
  production.

There are a lot of considerations when it comes to choosing a platform for
deploying your application, such as:

- **Cost**: How much will this platform charge me? How much do I get for free?
  Flat rate per month? Calculated based on usage?
- **Ease of use**: How much work does it take to deploy my application the first
  time? How easy is it to deploy new versions?
- **Scalability**: As my application gets more users, how easy is it to handle
  increased traffic?
- **Performance**: Does my application need to handle a lot of traffic? Be optimized
  for video processing? Store a lot of files? Handle large database tables?

For now, since we're deploying our very first Flask projects, we're going to
prioritize **cost** and **ease of use** to decide on a platform, and use Render
for deploying in the coming lessons.

[Render][render] is first and foremost a Platform as a Service (PaaS), which
means they manage the hardware your code runs on as well as the software
environment, with an aim of making it as simple as possible to take the code
from your machine and run it on theirs. Render also has a free tier for
developers to try out the service at no cost.

[Heroku][heroku flask], [AWS's Elastic Beanstalk][elastic beanstalk] and
[Digital Ocean's App Platform][app platform] are also Platform as a Service
options as well, so you're welcome to try them out for future projects if you're
interested in exploring other options.

[heroku flask]: https://devcenter.heroku.com/categories/python-support
[elastic beanstalk]: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/create-deploy-python-flask.html
[app platform]: https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/app-platform/reference/buildpacks/python/

The downside to PaaS options is that they tend to cost more in the long run as
your application scales up, since you're not only paying for the hardware your
code runs on, you're also paying for the platform maintenance and security. They
also tend to make it more challenging to fine-tune the environment in a way that
is optimal for _your_ specific application, rather than _all_ applications
running on their service.

The upside is that compared to handling that configuration ourselves, using Render
will make it much easier to get our app up and running in a production environment
on a server.

## Conclusion

The end goal of developing web applications is to share them with the world, and
deploying is the crucial last step in this process! As a developer, it's
important to equip yourself with the knowledge of what it takes to deploy a
website so you can evaluate the available options and choose the right one for
your project.

In the coming lessons, we'll go through that deployment process with a couple of
applications of varying complexity so you can build the confidence to deploy your
own projects independently.
